## Project Details
The project was part of a 9-month Product Development Project (PdP) course organised by Aalto University in its Design Factory** premises in Finland. 
The project was initiated by and developed in cooperation with a multisector education provider and regional development centre Omnia with technological support from Microsoft and Lenovo and it was connected to City of Espoo’s Smart and Sustainable City Initiative. 
The motto of the project was “Everyone should be given the possibility to understand AI”.

## The AI Learning Experience
The AI learning experience was realized in the form of an Escape Room built inside a truck and it made use of a multitude of different technologies such as HoloLens, Microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi, VR, AR, robotics and more. 
As the purpose of the project was to educate all diversities of people, having the truck as a platform allowed the learning experience to be made available to all types of people in different locations, and the truck is, in fact, currently touring all around Finland.

The following are the giveaways of this project
1.For Non-technical audience

- How a learning experience about AI can be realized in an, i.e. creative, fun, unconventional way
- The audience is attracted towards learning about AI by the medium of completing the riddles in the escape room
- There is no need for writing super long codes or taking any difficult courses with the open source platform that we 
   are providing to create learning experiences

2. For an audience with basic technical knowledge of Hardware and coding:
- How our open source readymade platform can be freely used to create learning experiences about artificial Intelligence for everyone
- Fundamental knowledge of hardware (even with just using an Arduino) can be used to teach complex AI blocks such as Neural Networks
- Since everything is documented, there for the session is an excellent way of learning the basics of different types of hardware and 
  software with easy to follow the documentation on GitHub.

3. For both Technical and non-technical audience
    - How the people can contribute to the non-technical aspects such as creating riddle stories, 
      designs and technical elements such as improvising the already available prototype designs, VR scenes, etc.
 -How the following learning was given to the audience in the form of riddles
    a) Artificial Intelligence is a learning machine.
    b) Algorithms form the AI - AI is the collection of rules on how to process things.
    c) AI uses Neural Networks to process and connect information fed to it

## About the Documentation
This  folder contains the documentation of the all the codes, designs and instructions to replace the prototypes that were developed
while building the components of the escape room. 
If you want to build similar kind of escape room, you may use the documentation and comments in the codes as well the videos provided.

The prototypes of Room 1 have been divided in 3 riddle.

1. Riddle one: contains data and description of 2 prototypes namely: Paul Pet robot and his “foodbowl”
2. Riddle two: this folder contains data about the 2 prototypes one is code for Mircosoft Hololens and other is Keypad
3. Riddle three: this folder contains data about the last riddle, which includes information about the following prototypes:
	a) Neural Network, b) Smart Mirror with voice recognition, c)Little Timmy robot d)Door lock

Once all the riddles are solved by the participants, they enter the next room, by opening the hidden door behind the bookshelf. 
This room has basically the setup of VR and a VR riddle, 
the code for VR scene can be found at 	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WuCEEXeVgq_qkOBVjH8TLGzUyUM1TBZ6/view?usp=sharing
